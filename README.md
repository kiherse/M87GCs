# On the origin of M87's globular clusters
High spatial resolutions images of M87 in the optical and infrared range, from NaCO-VLT and HST, have been
analysed for deriving the stellar surface brightness profile of M87 in the most central region, under 80′′. Using
literature previous results, from IR observations in the inner 19.2′′ and in the optical range for the inner 80′′, we

classified the detected GCs in these regions into the two main metal-rich red and metal-poor blue GCs subpopula-
tions, associated with the typically found GCs colour distribution bimodality in giant ellipticals. We have computed

the surface density profiles for the two GCs subpopulations, observed in the infrared, in the innermost region of
19.2 ′′. Its agreement with the profiles derived from optical observations, till 80′′, show no dust extinction affecting
the GCs detection.
For the GCs detected in the optical range, red GCs dominate the surface density profile in the whole studied
region. From a radial distance of 35′′ on, both red and blue GCs surface density profiles agree with M87 surface
brightness profile. Inside this distance, the density of blue GCs decreases towards the center till almost fading. Red
GCs distribution follow the same behaviour as M87 till 20′′ (1.5 kpc), were their distribution becomes flatter than
M87 light profile. These results, along with other authors’ results (the similar colour between M87 and the red GCs
and its centrally concentrated distribution) could tentatively support the scenario where red GCs share a common
formation scenario with M87, while blue GCs would have been accreted due to canibalization of other galaxies
(showing a more extended surface density profile and beeing metal-poor). The lack of expected GCS within a few
kpcs of the galactic centre would then have been accreted by the central black hole.

#### This project about the origin of M87 globular clusters was performed under a Fellowship on Astronomical Research at the IAC (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias). The IP of the project was Almudena Prieto.
